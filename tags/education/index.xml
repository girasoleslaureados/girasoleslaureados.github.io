      <description>The debate that has absorved great deal of intellectual energy is about what is educational theory, what is it for and what it tries to achieve.
Up to the end of the 19th century educational did not exist despite the canonical texts as Plato&amp;rsquo;s Republic and Rousseau&amp;rsquo;s Emile.
